# Tarot Deck for Pasadena High School Art Department

When I was a teacher, a colleague from the art department asked if I could put together a little application to display random "tarot throws" of three cards each using art from her students. Because the colleague wasn't super tech-savvy, I wanted to ensure that the page would be as easy as possible for her to use. Ultimately, I settled on a very simple PHP app in Replit where all she would have to do is add the image files to the images folder, and everything else would be done (including supporting multiple image file extensions). She was very happy with the result, and was able to duplicate the project and use it for multiple classes!
